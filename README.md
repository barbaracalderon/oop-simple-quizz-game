# Object-Oriented Programming | Simple Quizz Game
This is an Object-Oriented-Programming (OOP) version of the "Simple Quizz Game" from _Dr. Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp_, from the London App Brewery. There is a list of random questions and the user must insert his/hers answers. If right, then you score! At the end, the final results will show up and you can check how many questions you got right.

Also, by the magic of OOP, feel free to change the questions as you wish.
